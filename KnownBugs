- <J_y| T> calculation
  The calculation of <Jy|T> is messed up and does not coincide with cr8s calculation
  
- Single-particle header when breaking time-reversal is not aligned
  
- Breaking two spatial symmetries at once is maybe broken? Breaking one at a time
  with a two-step procedure works fine however. To be investigated.
  
- ContinueMoment parameter sometimes gives rise to errors on reading input. This
  happens when changing pairing parameters (BCS <=> HFB).
  
- Cannot break Time-reversal and signature in one go. Seems to be no problem
  at all with an intermediate step.
  => Something is wrong with the transformation of Kappa
  
- When nwt is not correct MOCCa segfaults instead of printing an error

- When pairing is not strong it can be very hard to block qps in HFB. Some fail-safe
  or resetting procedure should be made.

- MOCCa cannot properly continue from non-tensor interactions + HFB to tensor interactions
  from file.
  
- There is something wrong with either the definition or the implementation of a 
  total multipole moment as it is not independent of quantisation axis.
  
- The Cartesian moments X,Y and Z are not adapted to the quantization
  axis yet. (As are iq1 and iq2)
  
- MOCCa with broken symmetries should at the moment not be able to take different
  quantizationaxis.
