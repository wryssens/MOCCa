- C potential
  When using Sly5like forces and breaking time-reversal symmetry, the presence
  of this potential makes the time-broken groundstate not be time-reversal
  symmetric.

- <J_y| T> calculation
  The calculation of <Jy|T> is messed up and does not coincide with cr8s calculation
  
- Single-particle header when breaking time-reversal is not aligned

- Jx is not zero when signature is broken from time-reversal file.
  -> Either signature breaking is wrong
  -> Or Jx calculation is wrong (more probable)
