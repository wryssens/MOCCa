- C potential
  When using Sly5like forces and breaking time-reversal symmetry, the presence
  of this potential makes the time-broken groundstate not be time-reversal
  symmetric.

- <J_y| T> calculation
  The calculation of <Jy|T> is messed up and does not coincide with cr8s calculation
  
- Single-particle header when breaking time-reversal is not aligned

- Jx is not zero when signature is broken from time-reversal file.
  -> Either signature breaking is wrong
  -> Or Jx calculation is wrong (more probable)
  
  
- Breaking two spatial symmetries at once is maybe broken? Breaking one at a time
  with a two-step procedure works fine however. To be investigated.
  
- ContinueMoment parameter sometimes gives rise to errors on reading input. This
  happens when changing pairing parameters (BCS <=> HFB).
  
- Cannot break Time-reversal and signature in one go. Seems to be no problem
  at all with an intermediate step.
  => Something is wrong with the transformation of Kappa
  
- When nwt is not correct MOCCa segfaults instead of printing an error

- Check signature breaking transformation => weir behaviour of Jz
